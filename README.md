Version I'm developing with:

go version go1.2.1 windows/amd64

## My thoughts

Initial setup on win7 was simple.
Intellij needed a 3rd party plugin to support golang (trvial).
SublimeText3 has syntax highlighting support for golang.

Go slices are like collections.
Functions can return multiple values. I guess that means less wrapping constructs?
Underscore used for "throw away" values.


## Krzysztof Kowalczyk's Parting thoughts

I think writing non-trivial web services is a sweet spot for Go.

Most of the needed functionality is part of standard library. For almost everything else there are 3rd party libraries.

Writing in Go is almost as fast and fluent as writing in Python but the code is order of magnitude faster and uses less memory.
